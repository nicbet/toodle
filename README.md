## Features

- ‚úÖ Add, edit, and delete todos
- üé® Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- üì± Responsive design
- üöÄ Fast development with Vite
- üê≥ Docker containerization
- üîí HTTPS with automatic SSL certificates via Caddy
- ‚ö° Built with Bun for speed

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerized builds)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicbet/toodle.git
   cd toodle
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Build

### Local Build

To build the project locally:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with the production build.

### Docker Build

To build and run with Docker:

```bash
make build
```

This will:
1. Run `bun run build` to create the production build
2. Build the Docker image `ghcr.io/nicbet/toodle:latest`

### Available Make Targets

- `make all` or `make build`: Build the Docker image
- `make clean`: Remove build artifacts and Docker image

## Deployment

The Docker image is configured to serve the app with Caddy, which automatically handles:
- HTTPS certificates from Let's Encrypt
- HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- Static file serving with SPA routing

### Manual Docker Run

To run the container manually:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -e APP_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com ghcr.io/nicbet/toodle:latest
```

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

### Automated Setup with Script

For easy installation, use the provided setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup
./setup
```

This interactive script will:
1. Prompt for installation path and domain
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with proper configuration
3. Set up environment files and volumes for Caddy data persistence

### Using Docker Compose

After setup, or with a manual `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  toodle:
    image: ghcr.io/nicbet/toodle:latest
    container_name: toodle-app
    environment:
      - APP_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./caddy_data:/data
      - ./caddy_config:/config
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Management Commands:**
- View logs: `docker-compose logs -f toodle`
- Stop: `docker-compose down`
- Update configuration: Edit `.env` file and restart with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
