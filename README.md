# Toodle

A modern, responsive todo list application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. All todo items are stored in the browser's local storage. The app is containerized with Docker and served using Bun for production-ready deployment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerized builds)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicbet/toodle.git
   cd toodle
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Build

### Local Build

To build the project locally:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with the production build.

To serve locally:

```bash
bun run serve
```

### Docker Build

To build and run with Docker:

```bash
make build
```

This will:
1. Run `bun run build` to create the production build
2. Build the Docker image `ghcr.io/nicbet/toodle:latest`

### Available Make Targets

- `make all` or `make build`: Build the Docker image
- `make clean`: Remove build artifacts and Docker image

## Deployment

The Docker image serves the app using Bun's built-in static file server. The app listens on the :80 that you can map to any port you like.

### Docker Run Example

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 ghcr.io/nicbet/toodle:latest
```

### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  toodle:
    image: ghcr.io/nicbet/toodle:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
```
